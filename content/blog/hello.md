I’m [tiltowait](https://github.com/tiltowait). I run a [few](https://tzimisce.app/#/) [popular](https://docs.inconnu.app) [Discord bots](https://docs.botch.lol) for World of Darkness (and more specifically Vampire: The Masquerade) games. Though the tech world is replete with stories like mine, it still surprises me that I’m only in my current career because I got annoyed typing out dice rolls on my phone.

This site will be a journal of dev notes, stories, etc. Almost entirely for myself and my own edification, but I need to store it somewhere, and if even one person finds it useful, interesting, or informative, why not here?
