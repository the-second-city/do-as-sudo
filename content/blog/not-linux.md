I first used Linux when I was 13-14. Like many nerdy teens, I went through a cavalcade of distros: Red Hat, Fedora Core (2), Slackware, Debian, SUSE, Gentoo, Ubuntu, Arch. I’m probably missing one or two.

But there was another. Not Linux. [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org).

The BSDs are weird. They’re older than Linux. They are closer to UNIX than is Linux. They have much the same userland as Linux. But they are decidedly *not* Linux.

I first tried FreeBSD around 2004. I had a brand-new Athlon64 3200+. Windows didn’t have a 64-bit version yet, and I was itching to take advantage of the extra bits (not understanding they didn’t mean much for performance). Enter FreeBSD.

It was actually a failure, thanks (of course) to driver issues. A generous (not to mention patient) user on [Freenode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenode) spent hours teaching me how to build a new kernel. That was my first introduction to `vi` (not `vim`; the default FreeBSD install didn’t and still doesn’t come with something as new as a 1991 text editor). And after hours of work, we learned that the FreeBSD Radeon drivers just didn’t compile on amd64, so I couldn’t have hardware acceleration. I wiped the install.

(Looking back, I don’t know why this was so important to me. It might have just been the principle of the matter.)

Spoiler: I came back.

I’m not here to convince you to install FreeBSD, so I’ll just say this: FreeBSD, like OpenBSD, NetBSD, etc. is very much *an operating system*, not a distro, and that shows itself in subtle ways. Look no further than [the handbook](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/) to see what I mean.
